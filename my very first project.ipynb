    "Our `aim` is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets. We're working as data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps, and our job is to enable our team of developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build.\n",
    "\n",
    "At our company, we only build apps that are **free** to download and install, and our main `source of revenue` consists of in-app ads. This means that our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by `the number of users that use our app`. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.\n",
    "\n",
    "at first we will analyze and clean all the data and the data for us here is google play apps at the year of 2018 click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) to download the data set."
